                            <p> A 750-page novel that my friend and I wrote over the course of two years. The plot is chock-full of action-thriller romance. It's told from a girl's point of view, and the plot revolves primarily around her haunting past and how it continues to haunt her in the present.</p>

                                    <p>It only takes one person to change your life, a few seconds to fall in love, and one day to lose it all. At the age of 19, it only took one day for Karolia to lose everything. Her mother and father... Her joy had given way to grief and loneliness. She fled from Worcester, her hometown, to a crowded city, New York City, to escape the nightmares and memories of her parents' deaths. She is sweet, childish, and strong, and she is everything a good girl requires. Falling in love, for him, is a bad distraction that only leads to heartbreak. Logan carries a lot of responsibility as the CEO of a large corporation. Fighting was his way of escaping reality. He's dangerous, devilishly attractive, and everything a bad boy requires. When these two people cross paths, a whirlwind of emotions erupts - hatred, love, happiness, fear, heartbreak, vengeance,... They transform each other's lives and perceptions and are the ideal soulmates. For him, love is no longer a bad distraction, but rather a perfect one. However, every tale has a villain. Her past is the one in this, and she has no way out. Will Logan be able to save her from her nightmare or will he have to let her go for good? Prepare to embark on a new adventure, solve new mysteries, and create new memories. After all, distraction can be beneficial as well as detrimental. It all depends on how we see.</p>
